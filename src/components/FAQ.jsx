      question: "What if I'm not home during service?",
      answer: "No problem! Our techs access your pool area directly and leave everything secure. We'll send you a service report after each visit so you know exactly what was done.",
    },
    {
      id: 'item-2',
      question: "Are there hidden fees?",
      answer: "Never. Our pricing is transparent and includes chemicals for standard service. If any additional work is needed, we'll always contact you first for approval.",
    },
    {
      id: 'item-3',
      question: "How often will you come?",
      answer: "Weekly service is our specialty—consistent, reliable care you can count on. We come the same day each week, rain or shine, to keep your pool in perfect condition.",
    },
    {
      id: 'item-4',
      question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
      answer: "Yes. We believe you'll stay because you love the service, not because you're locked in. We offer month-to-month service with no long-term contracts.",
    },
    {
      id: 'item-5',
      question: "What chemicals do you use?",
      answer: "We use only professional-grade, EPA-approved pool chemicals. We carefully balance your water chemistry to ensure it's safe, clear, and comfortable for swimming.",
    },
    {
      id: 'item-6',
      question: "Do you service commercial pools?",
      answer: "Absolutely! While we specialize in residential pools, we also service HOA pools, apartment complexes, and small commercial properties. Contact us for a custom quote.",
    },
    {
      id: 'item-7',
      question: "What happens if equipment breaks?",
      answer: "We inspect your equipment during every visit. If we spot an issue, we'll notify you immediately with repair options and fair pricing. We can handle most repairs in-house.",
    },
    {
      id: 'item-8',
      question: "How do I get started?",
      answer: "Simply fill out our contact form or give us a call. We'll schedule a free estimate, assess your pool, and can typically start service within a week.",
    },
